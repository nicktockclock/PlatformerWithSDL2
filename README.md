# PlatformerWithSDL2
 
This is the project I am currently working on after finding this video series by Limeoats:

The idea of the video series is to recreate Cave Story using C++ and SDL2. I've been following along with the videos, but instead of recreating Cave Story I've sourced some spritesheets and tilesets from itch.io and have been making my own platformer using the lessons from the video series as a base.

It's been pretty fun learning about how to animate sprites using C++ and create maps using Tiled and other resources.

If you build and run it within Visual Studio it should run fine, there's a makefile included.
